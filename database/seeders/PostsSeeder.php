                            One might argue that it is his undeniable passion for the game and will to win that sometimes gets the better of him when decisions do not go his way.There is no doubting that since Ronaldos move to Spain, the gap has grown ever smaller between these two superstars and now -
                            certainly in terms of goals at least - there is a great case for claiming the 2 players are now on a par, or perhaps, that Ronaldo has even overtaken the Argentinian. Ronaldo has subsequently been crowned the best player in the world in 3 of the last 4 years (as of January 2017), and is favourite to win the awards once again, which would put him equal with Lionel Messi on 5 Ballon dOr trophies; a truly staggering achievement.Whatever your stance, there is little doubt that these 2 players are light years ahead of anybody else playing the game today, and will surely go down as 2 of footballs all time greatest ever players.',

                            Having been recognised as the best player on the planet for 2021, Messi is now two triumphs clear of eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo  with a five-time winner now at Manchester United finishing outside

                            The MEN reported that Rangnick has spoken to Haaland father, Alf-Inge, about a possible move to United, and since then, they have been heavily linked with a move for the Norwegian.
                            Manchester City has also been linked to Haaland, but German journalist Christian Falk feels there is one reason he may end up on the red side of the city.
                            Haaland is a better fit at United than at City, but I also feel that it will be very tough to get him. Other clubs such as Real Madrid and Chelsea will be in for his signature, but lets wait and see!',
